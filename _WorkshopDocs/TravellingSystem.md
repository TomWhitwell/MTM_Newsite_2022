Congratulations, you're on this page because some nice person has lent you a Music Thing Modular Workshop System.  

This is what you should do now: 

- **Play it** - for a couple of weeks. 
- **Share it** - photo, video, audio - please tag [@musicthingmodular](https://www.instagram.com/musicthingmodular/)
- **Pass it on** - to someone who will enjoy it. Do this face-to-face so you can explain it all. 


## How to get started
- Write your name in the log in the case
- Please [DM](https://www.instagram.com/musicthingmodular/) or [email](mailto:tom@musicthing.co.uk?subject=Travelling%20System) me - I want to see where they've got to. 
- The green cable pouch contains an international power supply and a USB-C cable: Gently pull the Workshop System out of it's case and **use the USB-C connector on the back** to power the system - the one on the Computer Module won't power the system.
