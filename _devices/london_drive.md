pars:
- "London Drive is a simple but pleasing distortion circuit and a good way to learn soldering."
- "The circuit is based on the external input and mic pre-amp circuit from the <a href=https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/ems-vcs3-retrozone>EMS VCS-3</a>, the classic British synth, designed at the EMS studios at <a href=https://goo.gl/maps/TgMLVLWi5vtVG18q7>49 Deodar Road</a>, Putney. The same circuit was used in the Synthi-A briefcase."
- "London Drive is obviously very similar to <a href=https://www.musicthing.co.uk/Mini-Drive/>Mini Drive</a>, which is based on the input circuit from a MiniMoog. It has the same two-in two-out layout to make it easy to patch feedback loops."
- "Does London Drive sound different from Mini Drive? I think so. To me, Mini Drive has an interesting saggy(?) quality, it reacts strangely to big gain changes, and is very mid-rangey. London drive is clearer, faster(?), brighter, more bass, more treble."
- "It's a simple discrete circuit: three transistors for the audio, three more to drive the incandescent overdrive bulb. The VCS-3 didn't have a level indicator, so it's just the Moog circuit here. Along with modern transistors, there are also a few minor changes to the VCS-3 circuit to make it work in this context, so purists should look away."
- "To make feedback patching easier, the bottom output is inverted, the top output isn't. Inversion is done by a very basic transistor phase splitter circuit, so the outputs aren't identical (DivKid explains this in his video below)."
- "Check the <a href=https://www.musicthing.co.uk/Mini-Drive/>Mini Drive</a> documentation and videos for patch ideas and feedback tips."
