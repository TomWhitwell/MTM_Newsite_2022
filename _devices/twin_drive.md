pars:
- "There are at least four nice things about Twin Drive. It's easy to make, it sounds great, it looks cool and it's stereo."
- "There's a famous trick on the MiniMoog where you <a href=https://youtu.be/foCy7ejg7pA?t=343>patch the audio output back into the external audio input</a>. It adds a load of warmth and saturation and gggrrrrrrr to the sound. Stereo Drive lets you do that on your modular, twice."
- "The drive circuits are identical to the Mini Drive. You lose the two-in, two-out feedback flexibility, but gain a second channel, useful for processing stereo signals, stereo-izing mono signals (different distortion on left & right = stereo-ish sounds), or doubling up for drive-into-drive mayhem."
- "<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yrwLULspzpE>DivKid's Distortion Masterclass</a> is the best way to get to know the module."
- "Even if you've never put together a DIY kit before, Twin Drive is a great way to start. Most of the components are tiny surface mount parts that are pre-soldered, so you only have to attach four sockets, one potentiometer, a power header and two incandescent bulbs. It's a quick but satisfying build that's ideal for beginners."
