- "The Turing Machine makes music for you. It's a binary sequencer, based around a 16 bit
memory circuit called a shift register.
It’s a sequencer that you can <i>steer</i> in one
direction or another, not one that you can program
precisely."
- "You cannot program this sequencer to play
specific tunes. You cannot save sequences. You can
never go back to a sequence that has changed."
- "To put it another way: the Turing Machine produces <i>clocked stepped randomly changing control voltages</i>. In other words, melodies, basslines, sequences. Unlike many random voltage generators, these sequences can be locked into loops that repeat according to the length control."
- "The Turing Machine has become one of the most popular Eurorack DIY projects since June 2012. The <a href=https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/turingmachine/>#turingmachine tag on Instagram</a> contains lots of great demos (and a certain amount of the real Alan Turing)."
- "This <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le26BIqB8Y8>27 minute video from DivKid explains everything</a> you need to know about the Turing Machine and the expanders."
- "And here's me talking for 20 minutes about <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QflL8PHQ2YU>how the Turing machine works and how it was designed</a>."
- "<a href=https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/music-thing-modular-turing-machine-mkii>Here is a nice review of the Turing Machine from Sound on Sound Magazine</a>"
- "Turing Machine Expanders connect to the back of the module, and take the sequence from the main module and use it in different ways:
<ul>
<li><a href=../Turing-Volts-Expander/>Volts</a> adds an extra voltage output, with the sequence set by five pots. 
</li>
<li><a href=../Turing-Pulse-Expander/>Pulses</a> turns the sequence into beats: eleven rhythmic pulse-train outputs. 
</li>
<li><a href=../Turing-Voltages-Expander/>Voltages</a> adds two CV outputs controlled by 8 faders. 
</li>
<li><a href=../Turing-Vactrol-Mix-Expander/>Vactrol Mix</a> is a sequencer controlled matrix mixer. It's fantastic for rhythmically cutting up audio, stereo panning and feedback loops, but a little hard to explain.
</li>
</ul>"
- "In the Turing Machine, looping is controlled by the big knob. 
<ul>
<li>At noon, the sequences are random. 
<li>At 5 o'clock, it locks into a repeating sequence. 
<li>At 7 o'clock, it double locks into a repeating sequence twice as long as the 'length' setting. 
<li>At 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock, it slips; looping but occasionally changing notes. 
</ul>"
- "You can <a href=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2017/12/01/free-vcv-rack-software-modular-synth-gets-ableton-link-turing-machine-modules/>try out a fully operational Turing Machine + Pulses + Volts in the free VCV Rack software</a>"
- "Electronically, the circuit was inspired by the long history of shift register pseudorandom synth circuits, including the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZVyl8HkxWU>Triadex Muse</a>, <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq_f6gdEDI8>Buchla 266 Source of Uncertainty</a> and <a href=http://mamonu.weebly.com/wiard-noisering.html>Grant Richter's Noisering</a>.</li>
<li class=articleList>Musically, the module was inspired by 60s and 70s minimalist process music by people like Steve Reich, Terry Riley or Philip Glass: 
<i>“I am interested in perceptible processes. I want to be able to hear the process happening throughout the music.To facilitate closely detailed listening a musical process should happen extremely gradually.”</i> Steve Reich, <a href=http://musicgrad.ucsd.edu/~dwd/2014_music14/reich.pdf>Music as a Gradual Process</a>, 1968"
- "While designing the Turing Machine, I compiled this <a href=../collateral/Random-Reading-List.pdf>Random Reading List</a> which includes notes on the history of random sequence generators from Marvin Minsky's Muse to Don Buchla's Source of Uncertainty to Doepfer's A-149 module. "
- "Tony Surgeon is a long-time Turing Machine user. <a href=https://vimeo.com/225625900>In this workshop from 2016</a> he shows how he uses it to generate sequences which are then looped on an Octatrack."
- "Turing Machine is open source, which has inspired many offshoots, alternative panels and third party expanders, including:
<ul>
<li>Mystic Circuits' <a href=https://www.mysticcircuits.com/product/vert>Vert</a> and <a href=https://www.mysticcircuits.com/product/leaves-black-panel-limited-edition>Leaves</a>

- "The Turing Machine is <i>not</i> a real Turing Machine <a href=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/turing-machine/one.html>the way Alan Turing explained it</a>. The name is vaguely relevant because the module uses a loop of data being changed, but the similarity ends there. It's certainly not a 'probabilistic random sequence generator based on the research of Alan Turing' ;-)."
- "The <a href=../collateral/TuringRev1Docs.pdf>original Mk1 documentation</a> contains more detail about how the Turing Machine works, including a block diagram."
- "The Turing Machine is a fairly straightforward through-hole DIY build, but it's fairly dense and takes a while to complete, so probably shouldn't be a first DIY project (I always recommend Mikrophonie or Mini Drive as first builds). Build documents are <a href=https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/turingmkii/?utm_source=MTM&utm_campaign=TuringMain>available from Thonk</a>. If you get stuck, the <a href=https://github.com/TomWhitwell/TuringMachine/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue>Github Issue List</a> is probably the best place to start - remember to check closed issues as well as open ones.
