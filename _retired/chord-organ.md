pars:
- "It's perfectly possible to create chords on a modular synth, but its a pain -  lots of tuning and messing about. I wanted to create something as simple as a home organ with chord buttons. Chord Organ is exactly that; the top knob chooses a chord shape, the bottom a root note."
- The full story of Chord Organ, including how it was inspired by a Bontempi Organ found in the street, is in <a href=https://medium.com/music-thing-modular-notes/chord-organ-the-easiest-way-to-get-simple-chords-from-a-modular-synth-2f48684fdb9a>this article over on Medium</a>. 
- "Chord Organ and Radio Music are identical modules; you can convert one to the other by installing new firmware over USB - <a href=https://medium.com/music-thing-modular-notes/chord-organ-the-easiest-way-to-get-simple-chords-from-a-modular-synth-2f48684fdb9a>details on how to install the firmware</a> - and go back just as easily."
- "<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebt4xdJwV1Y>This video shows</a> what you can do with a Chord Organ in a simple little case. Here the chord shape and root note are sequenced by an expanded Turing Machine and filtered through a <a href=https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/humpback/?utm_source=MTM&utm_campaign=ChordOrgan>God's Box Humpback Filter</a>."
- "The top knob chooses the chord shape (Major, Minor, Drop 3 9th). The bottom knob chooses the root note. Both can be CV controlled."
- "The <a href=https://polyfather.com/chord_organ/>latest firmware</a> now includes: 
<ul>
A choice of 12 waveforms (the original just had four) 
</li>
Program chords by uploading MIDI files 
</li>
Easy to use <a href='https://polyfather.com/chord_organ/'>configuration page</a>. 
</li>
Alternative tuning support by dropping standard Scala files onto the SD card (<a href='https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Chord-Organ/releases'>installation details</a>). 
</li>
</ul>"
- "Thereâ€™s a long history of press-button-to-get-chord instruments; accordions, the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoJY599SfU0>Suzuki Omnichord</a>, the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRyb02mfrdY>Autoharp</a>, or all those auto-accompaniment electronic keyboards that you used to see.
