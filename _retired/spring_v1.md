# Spring Reverb mk1

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

The Spring module started out in 2011 as a [perfboard design shared on the ModWiggler forum](https://modwiggler.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=36048).

In 2013 it was launched as project and sold through Thonk, which was replaced in 2017 by an updated version that is wholly improved, with improved audio and a feedback circuit. 

These are the files for the 2013 version: 

[Spring Reverb build and user manual](../collateral/Spring_2_1_Documentation.pdf) â€“ includes how to choose a spring reverb, how to calibrate the circuit, patch ideas and tips for getting the best results.  
[Block Diagram](../collateral/spring_v1_block.png)  
[Schematic](../collateral/Spring_2_1_Schematic.pdf)  
[Document bundle](../collateral/Spring-2-1-bundle_2017update.zip) includes manual, schematic, parts list, and design specifications for the panels  
[Spring Reverb_PCB Files](../collateral/SpringReverb_v2_1.zip)  Eagle and Gerber files for reverb PCBs and panels.
