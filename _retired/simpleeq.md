pars:
- "Learn SMD soldering by building two channels of the kind of tone
    controls you'd find on an old hifi."
- "The top channel has Baxandall bass and treble controls"
- "The bottom channel has a 'tilt' control like the one on Quad 44 hi-fi amps in the 70s. To the right, it gently boosts signals above 1kHz, cutting below. To the left it gently boosts below 1kHz, cutting above."
- "Like the Graphic Eq, this module uses NE5532 op-amps, and is based
    on a design in <a href=http://amzn.to/2wTCfmn>Douglas Self's masterful 'Small Signal Audio
    Design'</a>. It's a clean, simple circuit with very little noise."
- "The circuit is set up so that if you push a full-range (10v point-to-point) sine wave though it at a frequency that's being boosted, it will clip. Otherwise there's a reasonable amount of headroom and a lot of boost. In other words, just enough range to push sounds into distortion. Works well in a feedback loop."
- "Constructed with a handful of (relatively large) 1206 capacitors and
    resistors, it's the perfect first project if you want to learn SMD
    soldering, and it comes with <a href=https://thonk.co.uk/documents/simple-eq-kit/Simple_EQ_build_doc-v1.3.pdf>a detailed build guide</a> from Thonk."
- "Here is <a href=https://b.meso.tokyo/post/158856776659/mtm-simple-eq-diy>a nice illustrated build guide and demo</a> from Mesomesona in Tokyo."
- "This is a fairly simple build, but if you have any issues, the best
    way to get help is to check the <a href=https://github.com/TomWhitwell/SimpleEQ/issues>GitHub Issue
    List</a>, and remember to check closed issues as well as open ones."
