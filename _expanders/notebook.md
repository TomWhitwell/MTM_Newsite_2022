- "The Music Thing Modular Workshop Notebook is a 100 page ring-bound A5 notebook made for designing electronics, in particular Eurorack synth modules."
- "The book includes: 40 pages of dotted notepad paper. The dots are on the 100mil / 2.54mm grid used by most thru-hole electronic components. It’s easy to sketch actual-size layouts, but also works fine drawing schematics, logos, comic strips or lists of ideas."
- "There are also 40 pages of blank Eurorack panel layouts, from 2hp to 34hp. There are 145 blank panels in total, including 1U Intellijel and PulpLogic tiles."
- "At the back are 10 pages of rational troubleshooting worksheets, with advice, tips and a structured method for calm troubleshooting when something doesn’t work first time."
- "The inside covers contain at-a-glance data and information; pinouts for common chips and sockets, musical frequency tables, standard op-amp configurations."
- "Finally, there are also lists of recommended reading, sources of ideas and records to listen to while soldering…"
