pars: 

- "Tweak five potentiometers to set up another voltage output from the Turing Machine. This can be a different melodic sequence, related to but different from the main output."
- "This is a simple, low-parts count, low-current expander for the Turing Machine Random Sequencer in 4HP. It connects around the back with a 16-way ribbon cable and works with any Turing Machine (Mk2, or Mk1 with the backpack)." 
- "It acts like a variable 5-bit digital-to-analog converter, taking 5 bits from the Turing Machine GATES expansion port, running them through five potentiometers and giving one summed voltage output."
- "Multiple Volts expanders can be daisychained from one Turing sequencer to give melodically different outputs that are all related to (and change with) the main Turing sequence."
- "You can <a href=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2017/12/01/free-vcv-rack-software-modular-synth-gets-ableton-link-turing-machine-modules/>try out a fully operational Turing Machine + Pulses + Volts in the free VCV Rack software</a>. "
- "Volts is a shrunken version of the original Voltages expander, and was designed in one day while on holiday in Cornwall."
- "Volts is a very straightforward through-hole DIY build, that would be a good first DIY project. If you get stuck, the <a href=https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Volts/issues>Volts Github Issue List</a> or the <a href=https://github.com/TomWhitwell/TuringMachine/issues>main Turing Machine issue list</a> are probably the best places to start, although very few people have ever had difficulty with this module.
