- "Pulses turns the sequence from the main Turing Machine into a series
    of repeating rhythmic semi-random clock signals, that are based on
    the main clock input."
- "Seven of the 11 outputs are just the binary
    steps of the sequence on the front panel of the main module. The
    other four are derived from those pulses - so when steps 1+2 are
    active, the 1+2 output pulses."
- "As with most of the Turing Machine features, it is hard to explain,
but very easy and intuitive in practice: send pulses from the module
to anything that takes a rhythmic pulse; envelope generators, FM
Index inputs, drum modules or other sequencers. Very complex
polyrhythms come easily."
- "Because the Pulses are all related to the main module, they
    randomise, lock and change with that module. With the main module's
    big knob at 12 o'clock, the pulses are random. At 5 o'clock, they
    are locked, and at 3 o'clock they will 'slip' slowly over time."
- "You can <a href=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2017/12/01/free-vcv-rack-software-modular-synth-gets-ableton-link-turing-machine-modules/>try out a fully operational Turing Machine + Pulses + Volts
    in the free VCV Rack software</a>."
- "Pulses connects around the back with a 16-way ribbon cable and works
    with any Turing Machine (Mk2, or Mk1 with the backpack)."
- "Pulses uses Surface Mount components but is still a very simple
    build for anyone who has done a bit of through hole soldering
    beforehand."
- "<a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYYHior_EmY>Here is an epic series of videos from mixolydian2010 that documents the whole build process</a>"

- "<a href=https://soundcloud.com/musicthing/pulse-expander-clocking>Here's a very old audio demo from when I was developing Pulses, which shows the kind of polyrhythmic craziness it can create.</a>"
- "Despite involving SMD components, Pulses is a very straightforward
    DIY build, that most people complete without any problems. If you
    get stuck, the <a href=https://github.com/TomWhitwell/Turing-Pulse-Expander/issues>Pulses Github Issue
    List</a> or the <a href=https://github.com/TomWhitwell/TuringMachine/issues>main Turing Machine issue
    list</a> are   probably the best places to start."
