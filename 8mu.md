## Which version do I have? 

### Summer 2022: Text on back panel = 8mu Proto 3.1
* Latest beta hardware
* SAMD21 Chip, BMI160 6-axis Inertial Measurement Unit, 8mb external flash  
* Issues: 
  * Hardware midi Type B only
  * Prototype-grade PCBs and silkscreen 
  * Spacer at the back is 4mm, not 3mm = small gap behind switches and USB 
  
### Summer 2021: No text on back panel = 8mu Proto 2.1 
* As above (without spacer issue) 
* Should work with latest firmware - email me tom@musicthing.co.uk if you have any issues
